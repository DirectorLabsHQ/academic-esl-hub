# 📚 Academic ESL Hub | Linguistic Diagnostic Engine

### "Standardizing Language Proficiency for Global Scholars."
Academic ESL Hub is a high-precision diagnostic utility designed to map international English language test scores (IELTS/TOEFL) to the **Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR)**. Part of the **DirectorLabsHQ** network.

## 🧪 Scientific Foundation
Language proficiency is often fragmented across different testing standards. This hub utilizes the 2026 standardized mapping protocols to provide a unified view of a learner's mastery level.

### Proficiency Hierarchy:
- **C-Tier (C1-C2):** Proficient User (Advanced/Mastery)
- **B-Tier (B1-B2):** Independent User (Intermediate/Upper)
- **A-Tier (A1-A2):** Basic User (Beginner/Elementary)

## 🛠️ Performance Features
- **Equivalency Engine:** Instant cross-mapping between IELTS bands and TOEFL iBT ranges.
- **Mastery Tier Projection:** Automated CEFR classification based on standardized metrics.
