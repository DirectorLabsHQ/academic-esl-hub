# Academic ESL Hub | Global Proficiency Matrix
**Version 4.0 (Linguistic Data Engine)**

## 🏛️ Overview
The **Academic ESL Hub** is a professional-grade linguistic diagnostic utility designed for high-stakes English assessment mapping. It provides precise, research-backed conversions between **IELTS, TOEFL iBT, TOEIC (L&R), OPIc,** and the **CEFR** framework.

Unlike generic converters, this engine utilizes a **Precise Threshold Mapping** algorithm to ensure alignment with university-level academic placement standards.
