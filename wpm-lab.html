                        In exams like IELTS or TOEFL, the biggest challenge isn't the English—it's the clock. If you read slowly, you might run out of time before finishing the questions.
                    </p>

                        <strong class="text-blue-400 uppercase text-[10px] tracking-widest block mb-1">Better Focus</strong>
                        When students have a lower reading speed, they often struggle because their brain spends too much energy on individual words. This makes it hard to remember the "big picture," leading to frustration and lost focus.

                        <strong class="text-blue-400 uppercase text-[10px] tracking-widest block mb-1">Smart Improvement</strong>
                        You can't improve what you don't measure! Knowing your current <strong>Words Per Minute (WPM)</strong> helps you decide if you need to work on vocabulary or "chunking" (reading groups of words together).
